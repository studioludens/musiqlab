MUSIQ Lab
=========

The MUSIQ Lab is my personal collection of music analysis experiments. I use them to learn more about music theory and I hope you will find some use in them. There are two parts to it, the MUSIQ.js library, a pure Javascript library that can help you to analyze notes, chords, scales and much more. Secondly, there is the Interactive Guitar experiment, that uses the MUSIQ.js library and some AngularJS magic to display an (albeit rudimentary) guitar on screen, where you can find notes, chords and learn more about music theory on the guitar. 


The following libraries have been used:
- Node.js (for the webserver)
- Twitter Bootstrap (for quickly building the website)
- JSDoc (for code documentation)
- Underscore.js

And a couple more. 

Installation
------------

Run the server
--------------

MUSIQLab uses (for the time being) only client-side libraries. That means you can run the code on any system of your choice, like Apache or any other HTTP server. If you have node installed, you can also use the bundled node-static server. Run it like this:

 node ./server.js
