Wait, maybe because they are...\n              </p>\n              <p>So, I set out to create an interface for learning guitar and understanding music theory\n                  just the way I want to, which means <b>visual</b> and <b>interactive</b>.

I'm an music\n                  enthousiast and an active guitar player. I'm also a nerd and developer and looking \n                  at current websites that help you to learn guitar, I couldn't keep wondering why\n                  they all look like they are made in 1999. Wait, maybe because they are...\n              </p>\n              <p>So, I set out to create an interface for learning guitar and understanding music theory\n                  just the way I want to, which means <b>visual</b> and <b>interactive</b>. Because I'd\n                  like to see what I'm doing and do what I'm seeing.\n              </p>\n              <hr>\n              <h2>Technologies used</h2>\n              <p class=\"lead\">Apart from being enthousiastic about music, I'm also raving about the new possibilities\n                  web technologies give us in building engaging online interfaces (I'm an interaction \n                  designer as well) and I decided to use the cutting-edge in javascript development technologies.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                  <ul class=\"nav nav-pills\">\n                      <li><a href=\"http://c9.io/\">Cloud9 IDE</a></li>\n                      <li><a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Bootstrap</a></li>\n                      <li><a href=\"http://angularjs.org/\">AngularJS</a></li>\n                      <li><a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore.js</a></li>\n                      <li><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/\">LESS Stylesheets</a></li>\n                      <li><a href=\"http://nodejs.org/\">Node.js</a></li>\n                      \n                  </ul>\n              </p>\n          </div>\n      </div>\n      <hr>\n"],[0,"    "]],"start1":2568,"start2":2568,"length1":4630,"length2":8}]],"length":3607,"saved":false}
