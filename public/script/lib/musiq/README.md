MUSIQ.js
========

#### A music analysis library for javascript ####

This open-source MIT-licensed library is your swiss knife of musical analysis. 
It allows you to descibe notes, intervals, chords, scales and other concepts 
used in musical theory.

It gives you all sorts of ways to work with these concepts, like looking up 
chords from notes, finding scales belonging to a certain chord, viewing the 
relationship between notes and more.

Still working on putting it in namespaces, writing tests and making it ready for
production.

Take a look at the MUSIQ.js primer. 

Instruments supported
---------------------

So far the only instrument that is supported is the Guitar. I'm planning to support
at least the Piano as well.
